Welcome to go-scaffolding-suggestion!

This repository provides a simple suggestion for organizing folders in a Go project. It is not intended to cover all aspects of security, development best practices, or production-ready configurations. The primary focus here is on demonstrating a straightforward code flow.

### Disclaimer

Security Considerations: This project does not address important security topics. Use it at your own risk when creating production-ready services.
Best Practices: Not all Go development best practices are applied here. The structure is only meant as an example or starting point.
No Warranty: This code is offered “as is” without any warranties or guarantees regarding its correctness or suitability for any purpose.
Project Structure

The recommended folder structure includes:

cmd/: Contains the main application entry point(s).
internal/: Includes internal packages that are relevant only to this project.
pkg/: Optional folder to store reusable and shareable code (not covered extensively here).
config/: Holds configuration files or logic.
scripts/: Contains scripts or utilities for setup, local development, etc.
